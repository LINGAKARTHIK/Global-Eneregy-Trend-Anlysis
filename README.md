\#  Global Energy Trends: A Comprehensive Analysis



\##  Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of \*\*global energy consumption patterns\*\*, \*\*power generation trends\*\*, and the \*\*transition from non-renewable to renewable energy sources\*\* across countries and continents.



Using \*\*Power BI dashboards\*\* and cleaned global datasets, the project enables \*\*data-driven decision-making\*\* for:

\- Policymakers

\- Energy decision-makers

\- Industry professionals

\- Researchers

\- Students and learners



The analysis spans \*\*1990–2020\*\* for energy consumption and \*\*1997–2017\*\* for renewable power generation.

\##  Objectives

\- Consolidate fragmented global energy datasets into a unified model  

\- Analyze \*\*country-wise and continent-wise energy consumption trends\*\*

\- Track the \*\*growth of renewable energy sources\*\*

\- Compare \*\*renewable vs non-renewable energy contributions\*\*

\- Build \*\*interactive Power BI dashboards\*\* for exploration and insights

\- Support strategic decisions in \*\*energy planning and sustainability\*\*



---



\##  Problem Statement

Despite the availability of global energy data, it is:

\- Scattered across multiple platforms

\- Difficult to interpret due to technical complexity

\- Lacking interactive and visual insights



This project solves that by providing a \*\*single, easy-to-understand, visual analytics platform\*\*.

\##  Tools \& Technologies

\- \*\*Power BI Desktop\*\*

\- \*\*Python (Pandas, NumPy)\*\*

\- \*\*Jupyter Notebook\*\*

\- \*\*Git \& GitHub\*\*

\- \*\*Power Query \& DAX\*\*



---



\##  Data Sources

\- Kaggle – Global Energy Statistics  

\- International Energy Agency (IEA)  

\- World Bank  

\- U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)



 \*\*Total datasets used:\*\* 6 CSV files  

 \*\*Countries covered:\*\* 255  

 \*\*Time span:\*\* Up to 30 years

\##  Data Processing

\### Data Cleaning

\- Handled missing values using imputation techniques

\- Removed duplicate country-year records

\- Standardized energy units (MWh → TWh)

\- Corrected inconsistent column formats



\### Data Transformation

\- Filtered relevant time periods

\- Created calculated fields:

&nbsp; - Total Renewable Energy

&nbsp; - Renewable Energy Percentage

&nbsp; - Per-capita indicators (where applicable)

\- Built a \*\*star schema data model\*\* in Power BI



---



\##  Data Model \& DAX Measures

Key DAX measures include:

\- Total Renewable Power

\- Total Non-Renewable Power

\- Percentage Renewable

\- Average Country Consumption

\- Statistical measures (Sum, Median, Std Dev, Variance)

\##  Dashboards Developed

\### 1️ Global Energy Consumption Over Time

\- Country-wise and continent-wise trends

\- Interactive year slicer (1990–2020)

\- KPI cards for averages



\### 2️ Energy Production – Sources

\- Renewable vs Non-Renewable comparison

\- Growth of renewable energy (1997–2017)

\- Distribution by energy type



\### 3️ Power Generation – Top 20 Countries

\- World map visualization

\- Country-level renewable contributions

\- KPI cards for major renewable sources



\### 4️ Executive Report Dashboard

\- Key insights \& findings

\- BRICS vs OECD vs CIS comparison

\- Africa-focused energy consumption trends



---



\##  Key Insights

\- \*\*Asia\*\* is the largest energy-consuming continent

\- \*\*China\*\* leads global energy consumption

\- Renewable energy grew from \*\*<1,000 TWh to >4,000 TWh\*\*

\- \*\*Hydropower\*\* dominates renewable energy

\- \*\*Coal\*\* still accounts for over \*\*50%\*\* of non-renewable energy

\- OECD countries show stable demand, while BRICS nations grow rapidly



---



\## Performance \& Optimization

\- Dashboard load time: \*\*< 3 seconds\*\*

\- Optimized relationships and aggregations

\- Measures preferred over calculated columns

\- Efficient filtering and cross-highlighting



---



\##  Limitations

\- Latest data limited to 2020 / 2017

\- Limited sub-national (state-level) analysis

\- No real-time data integration

\- Forecasting planned but not fully implemented



---



\##  Future Scope

\- Real-time API data integration

\- Carbon emissions \& net-zero analysis

\- Energy forecasting using ML (ARIMA / LSTM)

\- Socioeconomic indicators (GDP, population)

\- Policy impact assessment

\- Advanced geospatial \& ML-based insights
